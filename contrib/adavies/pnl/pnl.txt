profit & loss

a simple portfolio tracker

expects a file of transactions "xn.csv" in the same directory

xn schema:

c         | t f a
----------| -----
date      | d    
sym       | s    
price     | f    
size      | f    
commission| f    

fetches prices from Yahoo! Finance and calculates current market value
and performance for each position and for the whole portfolio

n.b. cash positions can be tracked as a (any) "self-cross rate"
(price always 1, e.g. EUREUR=X; note that USDUSD=X is currently not
working at yahoo)

n.b. also that cash positions (always gain/gainp 0) are included in
overall performance

displays position and portfolio p&l on startup

exits if -q is set; this is meant to support shell aliasing e.g.
alias pnl='rlwrap ~/src/q/pnl.q -q'
