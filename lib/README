This is a collection of q scripts from my personal library, providing
various utilities, interesting functions, and examples of q (and
occasionally k) programming.

Those scripts suitable for inclusion in a q.q contain a hook call
as their first line: it executes a nulladic function .lib.d[], if
such a function exists. It is intended that .lib.d[] contain code
to switch the workspace from default to something appropriate for
utility code; e.g. .lib.d:{[]system"d .util"} or
.lib.d:{[]system"d ",getenv`Q_UTIL_WORKSPACE}.

An attempt has been made to include a header in each such script
describing which other scripts from the library it needs loaded and which
functions from them it uses (the "require" line) and which functions
it provides (the "api" line). The general idea is that some scripts
in this library may use utility routines from other scripts, and these
headers should help identify which scripts need to be loaded in order
to use which other scripts. At the moment, this is strictly advisory,
and not necessarily fully accurate.

An example q.q loading all such scripts (ignoring path issues):

.lib.d:{system"d .util"}
\l csl.q
\l debug.q
\l hdb_assert.q
\l histo.q
\l jrank.q
\l lines.q
\l metax.q
\l statx.q
\l ungroupx.q
\l util.q
\l venn.q
\l wheretf.q
\l wtf.q
